# Options Pricing Model

## Overview

This project involves building models to price options using two well-known methods: the Black-Scholes method and the Binomial option pricing model. The project utilizes various Python libraries for numerical computation and data visualization.

## Features

- **Black-Scholes Method**: Implements the Black-Scholes formula for pricing European call and put options.
- **Binomial Option Pricing Model**: Implements the Binomial tree model for pricing American and European options.

## Importance

- **Financial Analysis**: Provides accurate pricing of options, which is crucial for traders and financial analysts in making informed investment decisions.
- **Risk Management**: Helps in assessing the risk and potential returns of options, allowing for better hedging strategies.
- **Educational Value**: Serves as a practical implementation of theoretical models, aiding in the understanding of option pricing mechanisms.

## Project Structure

- **black_scholes.py**: Script to calculate option prices using the Black-Scholes method.
- **binomial_option.py**: Script to calculate option prices using the Binomial option pricing model.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
